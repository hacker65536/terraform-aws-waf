### 6. Validation and Best Practices
- Added input validation for processor configurations
- Implemented better error messages for configuration issues
- Created troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Documented best practices for each feature

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Functionality Testing**:
   - Deploy the module with each logging destination type
   - Verify logs are delivered to the correct destination
   - Check that IAM roles have appropriate permissions

2. **Firehose Processing Testing**:
   - Test with the AppendDelimiterToRecord processor
   - Test with metadata extraction configuration
   - Test with data format conversion (Parquet)
   - Verify processor validation rules catch errors

3. **Timezone Configuration Testing**:
   - Test with different time zones (UTC, local time zone)
   - Verify date patterns in S3 prefixes are correctly formatted
   - Test with complex prefix patterns using multiple date components

4. **Athena Integration Testing**:
   - Deploy the Athena integration example
   - Run queries against the converted data
   - Verify partitioning works correctly for date-based queries
   - Test performance with different data volumes

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test the module in various AWS environments
2. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate performance with high log volumes
3. **Security Review**: Conduct a security review of IAM permissions
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Add automated tests for continuous integration
5. **Extend Examples**: Create more real-world examples for specific use cases
